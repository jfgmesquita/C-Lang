### Using Ubuntu (Linux)

***

Each folder contains a different exercise along with its Makefile and README.

The main objective of these exercises is to learn key concepts in the C programming language, such as operands and operators, expressions, structures and unions, bit operators, pointers, virtual memory organisation, the C preprocessor, input/output (I/O) operations and Makefiles as well.

The provided Makefile is a generic template that demonstrates and explains the rules and instructions for compiling C programs using make.
