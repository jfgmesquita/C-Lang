# Hello World Program

This program prints "Hello, World!" to the standard output.

## Files

- `hw.c`: The source code for the Hello World program.
- `Makefile`: The Makefile to compile and run the program.

## Compilation and Usage

To compile and run the program, open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing `hw.c` and the `Makefile`. Run the following command:

```sh
make run
```

This will compile the source code, generate an executable named `hw` and automatically run it.

## Example

Compile and Run the Program:

```sh
make run
```

Output:

```sh
Hello, World!
```

Clean Up:

```sh
make clean
```

###### This will remove the compiled files and clean the directory.
