# Operator Precedence Program

This program demonstrates the operator precedence in C by assigning and modifying variables in a single statement. The source code is in the file `op.c`.

## Files

- `op.c`: The source code for the operator precedence program.
- `Makefile`: The Makefile to compile and clean the program.

## Compilation

To compile the program, open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing `op.c` and the `Makefile`. Run the following command:

```sh
make
```

This will compile the source code and generate an executable named op.

## Usage

After compiling the program, you can run it without any arguments. For example:

```sh
./op
```

This will output the values of the variables a, b, and c after the operations.

## Example

Compile the Program:

```sh
make
```

Run the Program:

```sh
./op
```

Output:

```sh
a = 20
b = 20
c = 20
```

Clean Up:

```sh
make clean
```

###### This will remove the compiled files and clean the directory.
