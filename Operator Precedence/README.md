# Operator Precedence Program

This program demonstrates the operator precedence in C by assigning and modifying variables in a single statement.

## Files

- `op.c`: The source code for the Operator Orecedence program.
- `Makefile`: The Makefile to compile and clean the program.

## Compilation and Usage

To compile and run the program, open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing `op.c` and the `Makefile`. Run the following command:

```sh
make run
```

This will compile the source code, generate an executable named `op` and automatically run it.

## Example

Compile and Run the Program:

```sh
make run
```

Output:

```sh
a = 20
b = 20
c = 20
```

Clean Up:

```sh
make clean
```

###### This will remove the compiled files and clean the directory.
