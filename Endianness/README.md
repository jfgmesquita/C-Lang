# Endianness Program

This program determines the endianness of the system.

## Files

- `e.c`: The source code for the Endianness program.
- `Makefile`: The makefile to compile and run the program.

## Compilation and Usage

To compile and run the program, open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing `e.c` and the `Makefile`. Run the following command:

```sh
make run
```

This will compile the source code, generate an executable named `e` and automatically run it.

## Example

Compile and Run the Program:

```sh
make run
```

Output:

```sh
Little-endian
```

Clean Up:

```sh
make clean
```

###### This will remove the compiled files and clean the directory.
